### Overview
Is it possible to reliably detect meteors using a software defined radio?

Two types of meteors: underdense and overdense

The underdense meteor's ion trail only lasts for a few tenths of a second and is normally dimmer. Is not ideal for radio waves to bounce off.
The overdense meteors'ion trail lasts for a considerably long time; a couple of seconds. These meteors are rarer and are brighter. These are good for bouncing radio waves off of but can be scattered by the high winds in the upper atmosphere.

There are white and dark parts during a meteor's flight that might lead to signal strengthening or signal weaking by interference.

The high winds in the upper atmosphere may travel 100 meters/sec witch causes Doppler Shifts.
