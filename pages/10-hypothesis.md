### Overview
Is it possible to reliably detect meteors using a software defined radio?

We are going to employ the forward scatter technique, where we detect signal from a distant VHF analog broadcasting station. We will achieve this by placing a VHF reciever tuned to Channel 2 (55 MHz) and measuring the reception through a software defined radio. Meteors will create an ion trail when they enter the Earth's atmosphere. These ion trails will reflect the radio signals being transmitted from distant sources. These ion trails can last for a considerably long time; a couple of seconds to several minutes. We cannot directly recieve these signals due to the Earth's curvature.
