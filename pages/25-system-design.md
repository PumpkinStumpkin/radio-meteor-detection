### Overview

1. antennae
2. antennae tower
3. low-noise amplifier
4. reciever
5. data storage
6. processing

#### Antennae
1. Objective: receive radio waves at 55.24 MHz, TV Channel 2
2. Operating requirements: 
* outdoors
* pointed towards Channel 2 station source
3. build 4 element Yagi antennae, aluminum elements tuned to 55 MHz
4. Procedures to test: create a sample radio source, find broadcasting station on air and internet

#### Antennae Tower
1. Objective: raise antennae to heigth that minimizes interference and optimizes gain for Channel 2
2. Operating requirements: 
* outdoors
* specific height determined by wavelength (need to determine)

#### Low Noise Amplifier
1. Objective: amplify recieved signal with minimal noise
2. Operating requirements: 
* outdoors
* located next to antennae

#### Reciever
1. Objective: 
2. Operating requirements: 
* outdoors
* specific height determined by wavelength (need to determine)
